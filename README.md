# Ashley Leduc - Professional Portfolio

This is a professional portfolio website designed for Ashley Leduc.

## Website Structure

The website consists of three main pages:
1.  **Home (`index.html`)**: A professional introduction with a hero section (no photo), about me summary, and navigation.
2.  **Experience (`experience.html`)**: A resume-style timeline of professional experience, education, and skills.
3.  **Projects (`projects.html`)**: A grid layout to showcase key projects and achievements.

## Customization Instructions

Since the content could not be automatically retrieved from LinkedIn, you will need to manually update the HTML files with your specific details.

### 1. Update Personal Information
Open `index.html` and replace the placeholder text in the "About Me" section with your professional summary.

### 2. Add Experience
Open `experience.html` and locate the "Professional Experience" section.
-   Replace "Current Job Title", "Company Name", and descriptions with your actual work history.
-   Update the "Education" and "Skills" sections.

### 3. Add Projects
Open `projects.html` and update the project cards with your actual projects, descriptions, and relevant tags.

### 4. Update Contact Info
In all HTML files (`index.html`, `experience.html`, `projects.html`), update the footer section:
-   Replace `your.email@example.com` with your actual email address.
-   The LinkedIn link is already set to `https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-leduc`.

## Styling
The visual style is defined in `style.css`. You can change colors, fonts, and spacing by editing the CSS variables at the top of the file.
